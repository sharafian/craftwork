# CraftWork
> Turn minecraft into your virtual office with Discord

CraftWork is a bukkit plugin that lets you designate areas of your server to
discord rooms.

Players on your server can link their discord account to their minecraft
account, and then join voice chat. If they enter one of the areas you've
designated, then CraftWork discord bot will move them to the corresponding
discord voice channel.

This lets you build a virtual office in minecraft, with meeting rooms that
correspond to actual discord rooms. Combine with a plugin like WorldGuard
to protect your 'main office' and give everyone their own personal area
to customize.
